It is clear that in technical rooms and wet areas we used porcelain stoneware, where the texture and color of the tiles was as close as possible to the selected wood.</p>

            <p>Substrate preparation is not just about digging a trench and pouring concrete. After the work of heavy equipment, the hard work of workers begins. Tampers and shovels are used. Compaction of the soil under the foundation allows you not to worry about its integrity in the future. You can be 99% sure that with proper preparation, the foundation will not "move" anywhere and will not be covered with cracks. The second stage is reinforcement. For reinforcement, steel reinforcement with a diameter of 12 mm is used. In this matter, it is also worth paying attention to the styling. We do not just lay it on the ground, like most builders, but use waterproofing and special plastic "mushrooms". Thanks to them, the reinforcement threads do not touch the ground and work correctly in the structure. The foundation is poured with concrete vibration. Thus, voids are not formed and the concrete lays down evenly filling the entire formwork.</p>
